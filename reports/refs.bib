	abstract = {Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are an important and increasing threat to global health. Both clonal spread and plasmid-mediated transmission contribute to the ongoing rise in incidence of these bacteria. Among the 4 classes of β-lactamases defined by the Ambler classification system, the carbapenemases that confer carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae belong to 3 of them: Class A (K. pneumoniae carbapenemases, KPC), Class B (metallo-β-lactamases, MBL including New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases, NDM) and Class D (OXA-48-like carbapenemases). KPC-producing CPE are the most commonly occurring CPE in the United States. MBL-producing CPE have been most commonly associated with the Indian Subcontinent as well as with specific countries in Europe, including Romania, Denmark, Spain, and Hungary. The epicenter of OXA-48-like-producing is in Turkey and surrounding countries. Detailed knowledge of the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of CPE is essential to stem the spread of these pathogens.},

	abstract = {Background
Carbapenem-producing Enterobacterales are an expanding group of Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to carbapenems and cause over 9000 cases of hospital-associated infections in the USA. Efforts to quantify the economic and societal burden to healthcare are important to inform resource planning to implement infection control programmes.
Aim
We estimated the healthcare costs during an outbreak of carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli OXA-181 in Australia. We aimed to understand the economic burden to hospitals of patients who are asymptomatically colonized with high-risk bacteria.
Methods
Hospital admissions data and associated costs were obtained from the State Health Department. Colonized patients were matched to non-colonized patients on age, sex, admission ward and diagnostic category. Mean healthcare costs and length of stay were examined using generalized linear models and accounted for time-dependent bias, patient age and ward location.
Findings
On average, colonized patients had six times higher mean costs (AU\$155,784; 95\% confidence interval (CI): AU\$77,892–285,604) than non-colonized patients (AU\$25,964). Mean costs for those aged 75–79 years were 50\% lower (P=0.02) compared with the youngest subgroup, 35–39 years of age. The mean extended length of stay was 12 days (95\% CI: 3–21) for colonized patients. Nursing care was the main driver of overall costs for colonized (44\%) and non-colonized (39\%) patients.
Conclusion
Patients colonized with carbapenem-producing Enterobacterales during an official hospital outbreak incurred higher costs than non-colonized patients. Although infected patients incur substantial economic burden to hospitals, the costs incurred by colonized patients is also high.},

	abstract = {Carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria (CP-GNB) infections threaten public health with high mortality, morbidity and treatment costs. Although frequencies remain low in Australia (total number of CP-GNB infections reported was 907 in 2022), blaIMP-4 has established low levels of endemicity in many states. Imipenemase metallo-β-lactamase types alone accounted for more than half of all carbapenemases in carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales isolates in Australia, particularly in Enterobacter cloacae complex. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase constitutes almost 25\% of all carbapenemases in Australia and was identified predominantly in Escherichia coli. The OXA-48-like carbapenemases include almost 10\% of all carbapenemases and are mainly seen in Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Although K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-type carbapenemases are rare in Australia, some local outbreaks have occurred. Most carbapenem-resistant (CR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Australia do not produce carbapenemases. Finally, OXA-23-like carbapenemases are overwhelmingly positive in CR-Acinetobacter baumannii strains in Australia. Treatment of CR-GNB infections challenges physicians. Of 10 new antibiotics active against at least some CR-GNB infections that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, just three are approved for use in Australia. In this context, there is still an unmet need for novel antibacterials that can be used for the treatment of CR-GNB infections in Australia, as well as a pressing requirement for new mechanisms to ‘de-link’ antibiotic sales from their availability. In this narrative review, we aim to overview the epidemiology and clinical significance of carbapenem resistance in Australia as it pertains to Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.},
